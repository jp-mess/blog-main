### [Author: John (Jack) Messerly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-messerly-567b9b96/)

<br>

Welcome to my after-hours sample work page, where I try to talk about engaging, tangible problems in my day-to-day work as an algorithm engineer. I focus on the problems themselves and handcrafted solutions to them, rather than writing about engineering concepts in an educational way (like in a towardsdatascience.com article), or research in a formal way (like in a conference paper). I wanted to these writeups to bridge that gap. I try to keep the material as practical and visual as possible, while not presenting information that is "too easy" or obvious. I hope you like them!

## [Colored Lighting Removal with VAEs](https://jp-mess.github.io/vae-color-article/)

An article on how to use a VAE and GIMP to efficiently remove complex lighting effects (that white balance algorithms may struggle with).

## [Geometric Priors in Ceres](https://jp-mess.github.io/relative-geometry-article/)

How to add "geometric prior" constraints to a bundle adjuster in ceres C++, in order to design structure-from-motion around realistic simplifying assumptions, and reduce global estimation error.
