Welcome to my after-hours campfire, where I try to talk about engaging, tangible problems in my day-to-day work as an algorithm engineer. I focus on the problems themselves and handcrafted solutions to them, rather than writing about basic engineering concepts in an educational way (like in a towardsdatascience.com article), or hyperspecific, obtuse research in a formal way (like a in conference paper). I want these writeups to bridge that gap. I try to keep the material as practical and visual as possible, while not presenting information that is "too easy" or obvious.

If you want to read my hyperspecific, obtuse conference papers, [check out my IEEE page](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086837268).

## [Colored Lighting Removal with VAEs](https://jp-mess.github.io/vae-color-article/)

An article on how to use a VAE and GIMP to efficiently remove complex lighting effects (that white balance algorithms may struggle with).

## [Geometric Priors in Ceres](https://jp-mess.github.io/relative-geometry-article/)

How to add "geometric prior" constraints to a bundle adjuster in ceres C++, in order to design structure-from-motion around realistic simplifying assumptions, and reduce global estimation error.
