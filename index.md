<br>  

Welcome to my informal algorithm design portfolio, where I try and present novel techniques to odd problems I find in my day-to-day work. I focus on the problems themselves and handcrafted solutions to them, rather than writing about the basic engineering techniques in an educational way (like in a Towardsdatascience article). However, if you contact me on LinkedIn, I'd be happy to clarify anything you see here.
