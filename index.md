### [Author: John (Jack) Messerly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-messerly-567b9b96/)


Welcome to my informal algorithm design portfolio, where I try and present novel techniques to odd problems I find in my day-to-day work. I focus on the problems themselves and handcrafted solutions to them, rather than writing about the basic engineering techniques in an educational way (like in a Towardsdatascience article). However, if you contact me on LinkedIn, I'd be happy to clarify anything you see here.

## [Colored Lighting Removal with VAEs](https://messy-bytes.github.io/Advanced-ML-Color-Fixes/)

An article on how to use a VAE and GIMP to efficiently remove complex lighting effects (that white balance algorithms may struggle with).

## Character Constancy in Stable Diffusion (coming soon)

What if I want to generate a few picture of the same person, but in different scenes? This is actually very frustrating with just img2img pipelines because of the lack of data, and it's very annoying to automate generating data like this (you can't scrape it).
