<br>

Welcome to my after-hours sample work page, where I try to talk about engaging, tangible problems I encounter as an algorithm engineer. I focus on the problems themselves and handcrafted solutions to them, rather than writing about engineering concepts in an educational way (like in a towardsdatascience.com article), or research in a formal way (like in a conference paper). While not being theoretically novel, I try to present writups that are not "too easy" or obvious. I hope you like them!

## [Colored Lighting Removal with VAEs](https://jp-mess.github.io/vae-color-article/)

An article on how to use a VAE and GIMP to efficiently remove complex lighting effects (that white balance algorithms may struggle with).

## [Geometric Priors in Bundle Adjustment](https://jp-mess.github.io/relative-geometry-article/)

How to add "geometric prior" constraints to a bundle adjuster in ceres C++, in order to design structure-from-motion around realistic simplifying assumptions, and reduce global estimation error.
