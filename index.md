Welcome to my after-hours campfire, where I talk about strange encounters in my day-to-day work as a computer vision engineer. I focus on the problems themselves and handcrafted solutions to them, rather than writing about basic engineering techniques in an educational way (like in a Towardsdatascience article), or presenting "new research". I don't think anything here is "conference paper ready", but I hope you like it. I try to keep the material as practical and visual as possible, while not presenting information that is "too easy" or obvious.

## [Colored Lighting Removal with VAEs](https://jp-mess.github.io/vae-color-article/)

An article on how to use a VAE and GIMP to efficiently remove complex lighting effects (that white balance algorithms may struggle with).

## [Geometric Priors in Ceres](https://jp-mess.github.io/relative-geometry-article/)

How to add "geometric prior" constraints to a bundle adjuster in ceres C++, in order to design structure-from-motion around realistic simplifying assumptions, and reduce global estimation error.
